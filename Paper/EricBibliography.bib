 {\it
 This will be a main source for my paper. It talks about evolving programs at assembly language level and its benefits. These authors focus more on doing this to use EC to debug, refactor, and repair programs. It also breifly mentions FINCH

This is a very short paper. I don't think I will be using it since it lacks substance. This paper is about using FINCH along side HeuristicLab to solve symbolic regression and other classic EC problems

@inproceedings{GISMOE:2012,
author = {Harman, Mark and Langdon, William B. and Jia, Yue and White, David R. and Arcuri, Andrea and Clark, John A.}, I also have ~\cite{NeuralNetworks:2013} and ~\cite{HeuristicLab:2013} as more research into using FINCH as an EC tool. However since these articles are so short and brief I don't think I will use them as sources in my final paper.
